# Heart Disease diagnosed Using Machine Learning
Build a machine learning model to predict the possibility  of a Heart Disease diagnosed in a patient, given you have a set of information  about the patient Build a machine learning model to predict the possibility  of a Heart Disease diagnosed in a patient, given you have a set of information  about the patient.


<h3>Data Provided :</h3>

-  Age : age of the patient

-  Sex : Sex of the patient

-  ChestPainType : there are three different types of Chest pain given to us

-  RestingBP : resting blood pressure is blood pressure in case of no 
   exertion to the body.
   
-  Cholesterol : Cholesterol reading

-  FastingBS : Wether the fasting blood-sugar levels is normal or not 

-  RestingECG : Electrocardiogram while the patient is resting

-  MaxHR : Maximum Heart rate

-  ExerciseAngina : Angina caused by exercise

-  Oldpeak : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

-  ST_Slope : Slope of the peak exercise ST segment

<h3>Steps Taken :</h3>

<h4>1. Clean the data provided</h4>

     ◦ Find and clear the null values

     ◦ Find and normalize the extreme values

     ◦ Remove redundant values

     ◦ Convert string features into numerical values

<h4>2. Create a machine learning model and finding their accuracy and 
confusion matrix</h4>
